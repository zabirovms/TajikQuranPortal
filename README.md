## Deploying to Railway

This project is optimized for deployment on Railway with a custom build process:

1. Create a new project on [Railway](https://railway.app/)
2. Connect your GitHub repository
3. Add a PostgreSQL database service
4. Set up the following environment variables:
   - `DATABASE_URL`: This will be automatically set by Railway when you add a PostgreSQL service
   - `NODE_ENV`: Set to `production`
5. The deployment will automatically:
   - Build the client application
   - Generate production-ready server code
   - Create a specialized entry point for Railway
   - Start the application with proper path handling

If you encounter any deployment issues:
- Verify your DATABASE_URL environment variable is correctly set
- Check the Railway logs for detailed error information
- Ensure Railway has permissions to execute the railway-build.sh script

## Database Setup on Supabase

If you're using Supabase instead of a standard PostgreSQL database:

1. Go to the [Supabase dashboard](https://supabase.com/dashboard/projects)
2. Create a new project if you haven't already
3. Once in the project page, click the "Connect" button on the top toolbar
4. Copy URI value under "Connection string" -> "Transaction pooler"
5. Replace `[YOUR-PASSWORD]` with the database password you set for the project
6. Add this URI as your `DATABASE_URL` environment variable
